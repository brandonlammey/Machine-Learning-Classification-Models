# Machine-Learning-Classification-Models

A test of select machine learning classification models in R. 

## Purpose

Machine Learning models are used to make predictions or decisions without the need of explicitly 
being programmed to do the task. The algorithms used fall within two families: classification and regression. 
Classification models predict a category and regression models predict a continuous number. 

## Models

* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* State Vector Machine
* Kernel State Vector Machine
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

## Properties

* Dependent Variables: 1 
* Independent Variables Selected: 2
* Note: The selection of only 2 independent variables can be changed but graphing will only allow
for 2D plots with 2 Independent Features 

## Configure

Download and run on R Studio in Anaconda
